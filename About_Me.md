# Data-Analysis
# ðŸ“Š My Data Analysis Journey

Hi, I'm **Joseph Gentry**!

My journey into data analysis began with a strong foundation in **mathematics** and **computer science**. As I studied patterns, systems, and problem-solving, I found a deep passion for uncovering insights hidden within data.

I started by strengthening my skills in **Python**, **SQL**, and **Excel**, building projects that explored real-world datasets â€” from stock market trends to environmental data. Over time, I expanded into data visualization with tools like **Tableau** and **Matplotlib**, and worked on modeling techniques like **linear regression**, **time series forecasting**, and **Monte Carlo simulations**.

What drives me is the excitement of turning complex, messy data into meaningful narratives that inform better decisions. Every project I undertake is a step forward â€” improving my technical abilities, sharpening my analytical thinking, and expanding my curiosity about the world.

I'm currently focused on mastering advanced topics like **machine learning**, **quantitative finance modeling**, and **automation workflows**, all while continuously refining my communication and storytelling skills through data. This repository will continue to grow as I explore new analytical methods and advanced techniques.
Thanks for stopping by â€” feel free to explore my projects and join me on this journey!
